An investment game, with a server and client folders, where the game runs locally so you can play with family and friends
First version made made by Chidozie J Nnaji
>__How to use__

>>2. Grab a friend, family, or anyone, run the game server and enjoy the game using the client exe or client raw code :)

>__How to use Server app__
>> 1. First start the server script or exe
>> 2. Hit/Click the 'Start Server' button to get the server running and this will create a seperate thread that will run while you, your friends, or family could join your server and enjoy the game :)
>> 3. When ever you are ready to quit the server hit the 'Stop Server' button and then wait for at least a minute before closing the application to properly close the servers and not cause any problem.
>> __Side note__
>>>If you hit the 'Stop Server' button but are not closing the server application wait for at least a minute before click the 'Start Server' button again because when clicking the end server we have to wait to stop all threads if not what this will do is create mutiple threads that might put to much stress on your system or cause problems to your game data.


>__How to user Client app__
>> 1. First log into a local server
>> 2. Create an account on the local server or use a already created account
>> 3. Once logged in you will be taking to a profile page, where all your stats will be displayed and there will be a button that will take you to investment page, where you could get investing and have fun playing :)
>>__Side note__
>>>The is no logout screen so if you wish to log out or join a new server you will have to all together quit the game and start it up again.
